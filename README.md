#SchoolSystem 
The requested program is in the SchoolSystem folder.
Requirements are to develop a web application using Java so the application can create,
read, update and delete data in this case it is a school registration system that takes 
in a student's name, course and fees data then gives the option to edit/update or delete data.
All captured data is store in a relational database using MySQL.

The user interface is created using HTML and CSS along with bootstrap for the CSS detailing.

As for deploying the web application onto AWS I struggled to set up a connection to the server thus 
I don't have the server link or URL to the deployed web application.

I only had theoretical knowledge of deployment but through this task I was able to get a basic understanding 
of how to use and the importance of it within large scale projects, the efficiency of having a web based application.
Although I wasn't able to learn as much as I could effectively to complete this task given the time at hand but an alternative
is provided in the SchoolRegistration folder.

#Alternative: SchoolRegistration
As a result of being unable to connect to the AWS server, I thought to show case my skill set with a
locally hosted alternative, which still satisfies the logical processes of authenticating the user and
also adding student's name, 2 subjects and grade, reading, updating and deleting student data.
All data is captured in a relational database using MySQL.
